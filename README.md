## Python - Week 9

Welcome to Week 9 of my Python journey!

---

## What I Learned

- How **functions** allow the user to encapsulate a piece of code and reuse it throughout the program, which leads to more readable and manageable code
- How to organize and import **modules** like a pro
- How to gracefully deal with errors using **try/except** blocks

---

## What's Inside

This repo includes:

- `exception_handling.py` - Where I practiced taming runtime errors.
- `functions.py` - Because reusable code is the best code.
- `math_operations.py` -
- `modules.py` & `modules_builtin.py` - Custom and built-in modules, side by side.

## Fun Fact

Somewhere along the way, I learned that wrapping code with three single quotes lets me "comment out" entire sections. Total life-saver while debugging.
